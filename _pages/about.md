I am Yueya WANG, currently a HKJC Global STEM Postdoctoral Fellow at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). I received my PhD degree at HKUST under the supervision of Prof. Jimmy FUNG and Prof. Xiaoming SHI.  My research interests include extreme precipitation forecast, aerosol-cloud interaction, turbulence process and climate change. I am particularly interested in applying data assimilation, numerical models and deep learning to the weather forecast and climate prediction.
