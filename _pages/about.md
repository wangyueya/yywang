I am Haobo LI (李昊波), a year-2 Ph.D. student at [HKUST VisLab](http://vis.cse.ust.hk/), Department of Computer Science and Engineering, [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/), supervised by Prof. [Huamin Qu](http://www.huamin.org/). Before joining HKUST, I obtained my M.S. and B.S. degrees from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and the South China University of Technology, respectively. I also have industry experience from working at Intel for more than two years.

My main research interests are **data visualization**, **digital twin**, **AI** and their application in **ENV** and other critical domains.

I welcome any ideas or collaborative projects related to my research interests. Please feel free to reach out to me via email.
